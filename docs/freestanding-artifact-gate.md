# Freestanding artifact gate

`rtgboard` validates a linked ELF image against a board descriptor before the
image is flashed. The gate reads allocated sections and unresolved symbols
from the actual linker output, then applies the board's placement, entry,
vector, import, flash, static RAM, heap, stack, and guard constraints.

For the initial CH32V003 profile:

```sh
go run ./cmd/rtgboard -board ch32v003 -vector rtg_vectors \
  -heap 128 -stack 512 firmware.elf
```

Successful and failed validations both print deterministic per-section and
aggregate resource accounting. A failed validation also prints every
localized violation and exits nonzero, so the command can be placed directly
between linking and flashing in a board pipeline.

The command consumes only a final linked artifact. Startup, vector generation,
linker-script selection, and instruction emission remain separate from this
host-side board gate.
